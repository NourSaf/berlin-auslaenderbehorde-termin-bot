Hey everyone! I've recently been hearing a lot about the difficulties people experience when trying to get an
appointment at the Berlin Foreignerâ€™s Office (a.k.a Berlin Immigration Office). So, I decided to do some research and
share my findings with you all in this blog post. In it, I'll discuss the current appointment process, its effects on
people's lives, ethical concerns, and the digital solutions that have emerged.
